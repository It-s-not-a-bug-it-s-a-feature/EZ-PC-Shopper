2. When the user clicks a build profile that matches their desire, that selection is stored in and the website loads the 'build area' page.  
3. In the build area page the user will be presented with a baseline 'recommended' set of components:  

- User can choose to just go with the recommendations as they are on screen.
- User can choose  selected components that meet their needs or desires from the components displayed on screen.  
- In either case the website will show the user the list of components they selected in a list below the categorical images of components.  

4. When the user is done selecting components, they click a checkout button that stores their selections and loads the 'shopping cart' page.
5. The shopping cart page shows the following to the user:  

- List containing each component selected and its cost.  
- A grant total summing all components cost.  
- A build-and-deliver estimate is presented to the user.
- The website thanks the user for their patronage and provides a link to the 'about us'.
