# EZ PC Shopper Overview

We want to make computer shopping easier for ALL users. We use visual aids to assist end-users to build a computer that meets their needs. Users may not know what the components are, and we take out the hassle of descriptors with visual aids and easy-to-understand language. It's a unique and effective way to help ANY computer user build and buy a custom computer.

Are you looking to buy a new replacement PC without worrying about every little detail, and you just want something that works?

We can help you!

Are you looking to purchase a PC for everyday use, and you want to customize a few components, like maybe memory or storage?

We can help you with that!

Are you a graphic designer or gamer that needs high-end components, and need to be sure you get *just the right stuff*?

We can help you, too!

## Project Description

An e-commerce website designed to walk visitors through building and buying a computer to meet their specific needs, and focusing on making the process easy, and appropriate for you.

## Problem Domain

Shopping for a new PC can be a daunting task. Selecting what is needed from component descriptions that are too technical or over simplified causes friction to potential customers.  

By asking our site visitors for what they are looking for, our website will make suggestions on what components to select to meet that need, with options if further customization is wanted.

EZ PC Shopper strives to make the PC customization and purchase process easy-peasy.
